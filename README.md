# Sorting Visualization Program

This program visualizes various sorting algorithms using SFML, a simple and fast multimedia library. It allows you to see how different sorting algorithms manipulate an array of elements to sort them in ascending order.

## Features

- Visualizes the following sorting algorithms:
  - Bubble Sort
  - Selection Sort
  - Insertion Sort
  - Quick Sort
  - Bogo Sort
- Allows you to choose the sorting algorithm to visualize
- Provides a graphical representation of the sorting process

## Usage

1. Clone/Copy Paste main.cpp the repository:

2. Build the program using your preferred C++ compiler. Make sure to link against the SFML library.

3. Run the compiled executable.

4. Choose a sorting algorithm from the menu by entering the corresponding number.

5. Watch the sorting algorithm in action as it manipulates the bars representing array elements.
